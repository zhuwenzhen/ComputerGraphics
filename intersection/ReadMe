## Part I: Performance
+ Cube, Cylinder, Cone, and Sphere works perfectly, I checked carefully with demo.
+ I tried to implement torus, but only did tessellation working. I don't have enough time to do the intersect. 

## Part II: Files modifed
+ Shape
	+ MyShape.h
		+ Changed computeTriangle virtual
		+ Added intersect(const Point3 & p, Vector3 & d) as virtual function
		+ Added new variable HitRecord hr to store the intersection pts;
	+ Added intersect function in
			+ Cube
			+ Cylinder
			+ Cone
			+ Sphere
			+ Torus (unfinished)

	+ Added new class: Torus.
	+ fixed old bug in computeTriangle(int n, int m) in Cone.cpp, now smooth shading works correctly.
	+ Modified ShapesUI.cpp/.h and ShapesInterface.cpp/.h to show Torus.

+ Intersect
	+ HitRecord.h
		+ added friend class Cube, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, and Torus
	+ IntersectionInterface.cpp/.h
		+ modified to show Torus
	+ IntersectionUI.h
		+ Added new variables
			+ Cube cube;
			+ Cylinder cylinder;
			+ Cone cone;
			+ Sphere sphere;
			+ Torus torus;
			+ Shape *shape;
	+ IntersectionUI.cpp
		+ Modified changeShape to 
			+ change shapes
			+ filled up tesselation vector
		+ Modified draw()
			+ draw shape
			+ perform intersection
			+ call drawHits to show intersection
